Repository for various data science and machine learning projects from Coursera.

## Rocket landing prediction using machine learning

This is my solution for the [IBM Applied Data Science Capstone project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone) on using machine learning to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. The project involved data collection through an API and web scrapping, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis using visualization and SQL, model development using machine learning classification algorithms, and creating a dashboard using Dash.


## Online Course Recommender System

This is my solution for the [IBM Machine Learning Capstone project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-capstone) on building recommender systems for online courses. The project involved exploratory data analysis, content-based recommender system using unsupervised learning (k-means and PCA), and collaborative-filtering recommender system using supervised learning (KNN, non-negative matrix, and neural networks).


## Comparison of Classification Algorithms

The notebook 'supervised-classification.ipynb' contains a simple comparison of some supervised machine learning algorithms for classification (logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, decision trees, and random forest), applied to the problem of classifying tumors. This exercise is for the IBM course ["Supervised Machine Learning: Classification"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-machine-learning-classification?specialization=ibm-machine-learning).

Additionally, the notebook 'unsupervised-classification.ipynb' contains a comparison of some unsupervised machine learning algorithms (K-means, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, mean shift, and HDBSCAN), applied to synthetic data. This exercise is for the IBM course ["Unsupervised Machine Learning"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-unsupervised-machine-learning?specialization=ibm-machine-learning).


## Comparison of neural network models for digit recognition

Project for comparing a few neural network architectures for digit recognition (using the standard MINST dataset). I compared the following models: 1) single-layer network using the MLPClassifier from scikit-learn, 2) two-layer network using Keras, and 3) convolutional neural network. This project was created for the IBM course ["Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-reinforcement-learning).
