Repository for various data science and machine learning projects from Coursera.

## Rocket landing prediction using machine learning

This is my solution for the [IBM Applied Data Science Capstone project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone) on using machine learning to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. The project involved data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting.


## Online Course Recommender System

This is my solution for the [IBM Machine Learning Capstone project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-capstone) on building recommender systems for online courses. The project involved exploratory data analysis, content-based recommender system using unsupervised learning (k-means and PCA), and collaborative-filtering recommender system using supervised learning (KNN, non-negative matrix, and neural networks).
