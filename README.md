Repository for various data science and machine learning projects from Coursera.

## Rocket landing prediction using machine learning

This is my solution for the [IBM Applied Data Science Capstone project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone) on using machine learning to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. The project involved data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting.


## Online Course Recommender System

This is my solution for the [IBM Machine Learning Capstone project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-capstone) on building recommender systems for online courses. The project involved exploratory data analysis, content-based recommender system using unsupervised learning (k-means and PCA), and collaborative-filtering recommender system using supervised learning (KNN, non-negative matrix, and neural networks).


## Comparison of Classification Algorithms

The notebook 'supervised-classification.ipynb' contains a simple comparison of some supervised machine learning algorithms for classification (linear regression, K-nearest neighbor, decision trees, and random forest), applied to the problem of classifying tumors. This exercise is for the IBM course ["Supervised Machine Learning: Classification"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-machine-learning-classification?specialization=ibm-machine-learning).

Additionally, the notebook 'unsupervised-classification.ipynb' contains a comparison of some unsupervised machine learning algorithms (K-means, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, mean shift, and HDBSCAN), applied to synthetic data. This exercise is for the IBM course ["Unsupervised Machine Learning"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-unsupervised-machine-learning?specialization=ibm-machine-learning).


## Comparison of neural network models for digit recognition

Project for comparing a few neural network architectures for digit recognition (using the standard MINST dataset). We use the following algorithms: 1) single-layer network using the MLPClassifier from the scikit-learn library, 2) multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using Keras, and 3) convolutional neural network. This project was created for the IBM course ["Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-reinforcement-learning).
